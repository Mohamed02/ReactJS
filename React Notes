2. What are pure functions:

The function which gives the same output for a given input variable (all the time) are called as pure functions. The function also must not modify any scope outside
the function scope

    the function arguments(objects) are passed by reference, hence a funciton could accidently modify the scope outside of it . Please refer to the below example
    
      function fun1={ var p1={name:"ismail"}; fun2(p1); console.log("value of name"+p1.name)}
     funciton fun2(p2){  p2.name="zaina"; console.log("value of updated name is "+ p2.name)}
