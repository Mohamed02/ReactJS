What type of ReactJS tool kit to go for?

1. For learing/creating a new react app or SPA you can create it through nodejs create react plugin
    run the command  to create an app

    npx create-react-app hellow-react --use-npm

2. For Building Pages which are rendered from server use Next.js

4. For Creating Native App go for React Native with Expo (I am not sure what is native app)




UseState function:

React provides a useState function which is a hook for maintining state in a function. Normally react has a state 
varialble only for components and not for functions

useEffect Function:

use effect function is helpful to execute any operation which are not a part of rendering ui, this includes
giving an alert message or console.log
